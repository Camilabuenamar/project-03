  description: 'The BEST BURGER IN THE WORLD is the Ari Gold at Patty & Bun. I\'ve eaten hundreds of burgers in my lifetime and have been in pursuit of the perfect burger for some time. This burger is it. You\'ll see a long line outside of Patty & Bun and that\'s an indication that I\'m not the only one who\'s discovered this secret. The Ari Gold features a perfectly cooked beef patty, gooey melted cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickled onions, ketchup, smokey P&B housemade mayo, and a brioche bun. Don\'t forget to throw on some tasty bacon to add that last bit of flavor heaven. The Ari is a melt in your mouth juicy, cheesy, salty, and tender masterpiece. The pillowy bun seems to melt with each bite and the ratio of the ingredients creates a perfect texture where none of them overpower the burger, while all of them contribute to the flavor profile. The ingredients are well thought out, portioned appropriately, and are high quality. The trick to the Ari is the cheese + bun + beef all being perfect. Add on the bacon, smokey mayo, and the rest of the ingredients that are all amazing too and the Ari Gold takes the definition of 10 out of 10 and turns it up to 11. If you are in London you must go to Patty & Bun. The burger was so great that I couldn\'t believe it...so I had a second to confirm it was indeed the best burger on the planet.',

Add in some shredded lettuce, crinkle cut pickles, and a bun that gives a perfect texture to each bite. It\'s hard to think such a basic combination would be one of the best burgers I\'ve ever had, but this one redefines a cheeseburger. Top quality ingredients and perfect timing by the cooks make each one of these a mastery of burger science. A word of caution that Sebright Arms or the other Lucky Chip locations can be a bit difficult to find, however they are well worth the effort.',

  description: 'This burger joint came as a recommendation from the experts in London. A few hour affair that pops up at the Brockley Market on Saturdays. The preparation at Mother Flipper is done right in front of you. I waited in line and my mouth watered at the expertly constructed burgers. A three-man crew consisting of a full-time assembler, full time flipper, and a bun toaster cranks out these tasty delights. I got the Candy Bacon Burger which consists of a tender sesame bun, candied bacon, juicy beef, shredded lettuce, pickles, ketchup, mustard, and thinly sliced red onion. Each of the ingredients on the Candy Bacon Burger are well thought out for flavor. A sweet and crispy bacon, tender and juicy beef, vinegary and tangy ketchup + mustard + pickles, melted cheese, and a toasted but soft bun to soak it all up. My burger disappeared before I had a chance to write too many notes about it. That is a good sign when it comes time to dish out a score. The Candy Bacon Burger is something to be admired for its well distributed and thought out flavors. A smart decision not to use a tomato really helps the texture, and makes this burger very focused on key flavors. Every ingredient contributes, but none overwhelm. Compared to the other top burgers my mouth felt a little dry, but this might be because I did not have a drink at my disposal while enjoying it. This is one of the best burgers in London and there is no doubt about it. A shame that it is not easier to get these burgers more than one day a week.',
